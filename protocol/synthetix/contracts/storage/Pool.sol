 * @title Aggregates collateral from multiple users in order to provide liquidity to a configurable set of markets.
 *
 * The set of markets is configured as an array of MarketConfiguration objects, where the weight of the market can be specified. This weight, and the aggregated total weight of all the configured markets, determines how much collateral from the pool each market has, as well as in what proportion the market passes on debt to the pool and thus to all its users.
 *
 * The pool tracks the collateral provided by users using an array of Vaults objects, for which there will be one per collateral type. Each vault tracks how much collateral each user has delegated to this pool, how much debt the user has because of minting USD, as well as how much corresponding debt the pool has passed on to the user.
