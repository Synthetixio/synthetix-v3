/**
 * @title Tracks collateral and debt distributions in a pool, for a specific collateral type, in a given epoch.
 *
 * Collateral is tracked with a distribution as opposed to a regular mapping because liquidations cause collateral to be socialized. If collateral was tracked using a regular mapping, such socialization would be difficult and require looping through individual balances, or some other sort of complex and expensive mechanism. Distributions make socialization easy.
 *
 * Debt is also tracked in a distribution for the same reason, but it is additionally split in two distributions: incoming and consolidated debt.
 *
 * Incoming debt is modified when a liquidations occurs.
 * Consolidated debt is updated when users interact with the system.
