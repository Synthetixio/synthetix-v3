/**
 * @title Module for connecting a system with other associated systems.

 * Associated systems become available to all system modules for communication and interaction, but as opposed to inter-modular communications, interactions with associated systems will require the use of `CALL`.
 *
 * Associated systems can be managed or unmanaged.
 * - Managed systems are connected via a proxy, which means that their implementation can be updated, and the system controls the execution context of the associated system. Example, an snxUSD token connected to the system, and controlled by the system.
 * - Unmanaged systems are just addresses tracked by the system, for which it has no control whatsoever. Example, Uniswap v3, Curve, etc.
 *
 * Furthermore, associated systems are typed in the AssociatedSystem utility library (See AssociatedSystem.sol):
 * - KIND_ERC20: A managed associated system specifically wrapping an ERC20 implementation.
 * - KIND_ERC721: A managed associated system specifically wrapping an ERC721 implementation.
 * - KIND_UNMANAGED: Any unmanaged associated system.
