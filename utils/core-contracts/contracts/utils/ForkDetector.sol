 * Used to determine if the currently running code could be running on a fork
 * Designed to make debugging easier for developers when working with parts of the system that work with offchain data or precompiled contracts which may not be simulatable in fork
 *
 * To use this in your fork, you must first set the special code on the CHECK_ADDRESS below. Examples on how to do this:
 *
 * ethers:
 * // you may need to modify `anvil` below to match the actual fork node you are using. be sure to check its docs!
 * provider.send('anvil_setCode', ['0x1234123412341234123412341234123412341234', ethers.toHex('FORK')]);
 *
 *
 * viem:
 * // set up a "test client" as explained here
 * // then:
 * testClient.setCode({ address: '0x1234123412341234123412341234123412341234', bytecode: viem.stringToHex('FORK') })
