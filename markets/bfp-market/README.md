# bfp-market

**Welcome to bfp-market!**

The _big ~~fucking~~ freaking perp market_ (or just BFP-Market) is a perpetual swap market, leveraging the capabilities of Synthetix v3 as its underlying infrastructure. bfp-market inherits core features from [v2x](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/tree/develop/contracts), such as dynamic funding rates, PD (Premium/Discount) adjusted market prices, and asynchronous hybrid oracle-based order executions through [Pyth](https://pyth.network/).

In addition to these features, it also introduces various enhancements, including multi-collateral support, improved dynamic keeper fees, user-adjustable keeper fees on order commitments, improved liquidations, a host of quality-of-life improvements, a strong emphasis on gas optimization _(soon)_, and obviously built on [Synthetix v3](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3).

The primary use case of bfp-market is to create a hyper-stable perp derivative utilizing wstETH as collateral, allowing users to open a 1x wstETH short with minimal negative funding, completely on-chain.

Please caution as this project is **_still under active development, not yet released, currently undergoing audit_**.

## Running tests

The test environment is a composition of `bootstrap` function calls, tighly coupled with Synthetix. As such, much of the design choices follow that of Synthetix V3 for consistency. A base `bootstrap()` function is provided which does the following:

- Invokes `coreBootstrap` from Synthetix to setup base Synthetix contracts
- Creates a single staking pool with liquidity to back test markets
- Generates TypeScript interfaces and aliases for test development
- Registers and configures perp markets with the core system

All of these operates happen asynchronously in loosely chained `before` blocks. You can execute tests by:

Two primary differences to note in how tests are written in bfp-market is all tests defined in `it` blocks are isolated (ensured by the `beforeEach(restore)` rather than a `before(restore)`) and the use of [generator functions](./test) and a mixture of [realistic market parameters](./test/data) rather than hardcoded values as input data for each test.

```bash
yarn test
```
