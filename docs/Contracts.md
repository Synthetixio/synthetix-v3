#### associateDebt

  ```solidity
  function associateDebt(uint128 marketId, uint128 poolId, address collateralType, uint128 accountId, uint256 amount) external returns (int256 debtAmount)
  ```

  Allows a market to associate debt with a specific position.
The specified debt will be removed from all vault participants pro-rata. After removing the debt, the amount will
be allocated directly to the specified account.
**NOTE**: if the specified account is an existing staker on the vault, their position will be included in the pro-rata
reduction. Ex: if there are 10 users staking 10 USD of debt on a pool, and associate debt is called with 10 USD on one of those users,
their debt after the operation is complete will be 19 USD. This might seem unusual, but its actually ideal behavior when
your market has incurred some new debt, and it wants to allocate this amount directly to a specific user. In this case, the user's
debt balance would increase pro rata, but then get decreased pro-rata, and then increased to the full amount on their account. All
other accounts would be left with no change to their debt, however.
