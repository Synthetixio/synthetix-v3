## Documentation

Please refer to the [Official Documentation](https://snx-v3-docs.vercel.app/) for high level concepts of the Synthetix v3 protocol, as well as auto generated docs from natspec.

## Package structure

This is a monorepo with the following folder structure and packages:

```
.
├── markets                      // Standalone projects that extend the core Synthetix protocol with markets.
│   ├── legacy-market            // Market that connects Synthetix's v2 and v3 versions.
│   └── spot-market              // Market extension for spot synths.
│
├── protocol                     // Core Synthetix protocol projects.
│   ├── oracle-manager           // Composable oracle and price provider for teh core protocol.
│   └── synthetix                // Core protocol (to be extended by markets).
│
└── utils                        // Utilities, plugins, tooling.
    ├── common-config            // Common npm and hardhat configuration for multiple packages in the monorepo.
    ├── core-contracts           // Standard contract implementations like ERC20, adapted for custom router storage.
    ├── core-modules             // Modules intended to be reused between multiple router based projects.
    ├── core-utils               // Simple Javascript/Typescript utilities that are used in other packages (e.g. test utils, etc).
    ├── router                   // Cannon plugin that merges multiple modules into a router contract.
    ├── hardhat-storage          // Hardhat plugin used to detect storage collisions between proxy implementations.
    ├── sample-project           // Sample project based on router proxy and cannon.
    └── solhint-plugin-numcast   // Solidity linter plugin to avoid low level numeric casts which can lead to silent overflows.
```

## Router Proxy

All projects in this monorepo that involve contracts use a proxy architecture developed by Synthetix referred to as the "Router Proxy". It is basically a way to merge several contracts, which we call "modules", into a single implementation contract which is the router itself. This router is used as the implementation of the main proxy of the system.

See the [Router README](utils/router/README.md) for more details.

## Information for Developers

If you intend to develop in this repository, please read the following items.

### Installation Requirements

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
- NPM version 8
- Node version 16

### Console logs in contracts

In the contracts, use `import "hardhat/console.sol";`, then run `DEBUG=cannon:cli:rpc npm test`.

## Deployment Guide

Deployment of the protocol is managed in the [synthetix-deployments repository](https://github.com/synthetixio/synthetix-deployments).

To prepare for system upgrades, this repository is used to release new versions of the [protocol](/protocol) and [markets](/markets).

### Preparing a Release

- Ensure you have the latest version of [Cannon](https://usecannon.com) installed: `npm i -g @usecannon/cli` and `hardhat-cannon` is upgraded to the latest through the repository.
- After installing for the first time, run `cannon setup` to configure IPFS and a reliable RPC endpoint to communicate with the Cannon package registry.
- Run `npm i` and `npm run build` in the root directory of the repository.
- From the directory of the package you're releasing, run `npx hardhat cannon:build`. **Remember to bump the version number of the oracle manager in the synthetix toml file after you're upgrading oracle manager.**
- Confirm the private key that owns the corresponding namespace in the package registry is set in the `.env` file as `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- Publish the release to Cannon package registry with `npx hardhat cannon:publish --network mainnet`.
- Increment the version in the relevant `package.json` files and then run `npm i` in the root directory. _The repositories should always contain the version number of the next release._
- Push the change to this repository.

Then, follow the instructions in the [synthetix-deployments repository](https://github.com/synthetixio/synthetix-deployments).

### Finalizing a Release

After the new version of the [synthetix-omnibus](https://usecannon.com/packages/synthetix-omnibus) package has been published, the previously published packages can be verified on Etherscan.

From the relevant package's directory, run the following command for each network it was deployed on: `npx hardhat cannon:verify <PACKAGE_NAME>:<VERSION> --network <NETWORK_NAME>`
