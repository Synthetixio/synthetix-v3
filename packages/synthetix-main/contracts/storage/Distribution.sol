/**
 * @title Data structure that allows you to track some global value, distributed amongst a set of actors.
 *
 * The total value can be scaled with a valuePerShare multiplier, and individual actor shares can be calculated as their amount of shares times this multiplier.
 *
 * Furthermore, changes in the value of individual actors can be tracked since their last update, by keeping track of the value of the multiplier, per user, upon each interaction. See DistributionActor.lastValuePerShare.
 *
 * A distribution is similar to a ScalableMapping, but it has the added functionality of being able to remember the previous value of the scalar multiplier for each actor.
 *
 * Whenever the shares of an actor of the distribution is updated, you get information about how the actor's total value changed since it was last updated.
