# Security Policy

Synthetix contracts have been audited by Iosiro, OpenZeppelin, and Macro. Please see our Discord for detailed audit reports for each release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We offer a bug bounty program through [Immunefy](https://immunefi.com/bounty/synthetix/). Please do not report vulnerabilities through any other channels, as we only accept security disclosures through Immunefy.
